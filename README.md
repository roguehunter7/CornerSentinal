## Computer Vision Car Tracking Detection and Speed Calculation with YOLOv8, Sort and OpenCV

Using the YOLOv8 Model to detect any Car from the Video or Image, and then that Detection is passed through the Sort Algorithm to Keep Track of the same Car.

To Calculate the Speed of the Car, it was used the ecuation `(V = D / T)`. The Variable Time was recorded when the Car crossed two Parallels Lines, and the Distance was calculated with the Eucledian Formula of that two Parallels Lines.

The Code of the Proyect is in the `speed_detection.ipynb` file and the Video Test is in the `video` folder.
